# Unemployment Analysis in India
# Introduction
Unemployment is a crucial economic indicator that reflects the job availability and economic health of a country. This report analyzes the Unemployment in India dataset, focusing on trends, regional disparities, and employment statistics. The dataset contains records from 28 regions and categorizes data into Rural and Urban areas. The analysis covers unemployment rates, labour participation, and employment patterns over time.

# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed before analysis:
+ Removed unnecessary spaces from column names and values.
+ Converted the Date column into the correct format.
+ Removed missing values to ensure accurate results.

# Findings and Analysis
# 1. Unemployment Rate Trends Over Time
A line graph was plotted to compare unemployment rates between Rural and Urban areas.
*Observations:*
+ Urban areas have consistently higher unemployment rates compared to rural areas.
+ There were sharp increases in unemployment during certain periods, likely due to economic disruptions like COVID-19.
+ The overall trend shows fluctuations, indicating seasonal or economic impacts.

# 2. Top 10 Regions with Highest Unemployment Rate
A bar chart was created to identify the top 10 regions with the highest unemployment rates.
*Key Insights:*
+ Some regions have significantly higher unemployment rates than others.
+ The highest unemployment rates were observed in states with dense populations and urban centers.
+ Regional disparities highlight the need for state-specific employment policies.

# 3. Labour Participation Rate Distribution
A histogram was used to analyze the distribution of the Labour Participation Rate.
*Findings:*
+ The average Labour Participation Rate is 42.63%.
+ A wide variation exists, with some areas having rates as low as 13.33% and others as high as 72.57%.
+ This suggests uneven workforce participation, influenced by factors like education, industry availability, and economic conditions.

# 4. Urban vs Rural Employment Comparison
A box plot was created to compare the estimated employed population in Rural vs Urban areas.
*Key Observations:*
+ Rural areas have a higher number of employed individuals, despite a lower unemployment rate.
+ This is likely due to a higher labour force participation in rural regions, where informal and agricultural jobs dominate.
+ Urban employment is more volatile, with greater fluctuations in the workforce.

# Conclusion:
